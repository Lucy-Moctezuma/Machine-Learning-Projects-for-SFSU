# SFSU Google Colab Projects
All work described below was supervised and sponsored under Dr. Pleuni Pennings, Biology professor at San Francisco State University, as part of her amazing efforts to create a space to teach coding skills and mentor underepresented students in STEM fields at [CoDELab](https://pleunipennings.wordpress.com/).

All notebooks in this repository are meant to be used using Google Colab. You can open the each notebook by clicking on the button on the top left of each of the notebooks:

You can then run, modify and save your own copy of the notebook's code.

## MARC Machine Learning

**Grant Recipient:** Raymond M Esquerra (Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San Francisco State University)

**Grant Name:** Demystifying Machine Learning and Best Data Practices Workshop Series for Underrepresented STEM Undergraduate and MS Researchers bound for PhD Training Programs

**Grant Number:** T34-GM008574

Contains 2 small projects geared towards teaching undergraduates a first quick glance at Machine Learning

**1) Workshop 1** (*Ported to Google Cloud Platform as part of [NIGMS Module](https://github.com/NIGMS/Introduction-to-Data-Science-for-Biology)*)
 - 1A) COVID data predictions using Decision Tree Notebook
 - 1B) Data Drifting and Model Performance Notebook
 - Dataset (Training (labels and features) and Testing (labels and features) CSV files)
 - Support Files (Unused for the Tutorial)
 - 2 CSV files (Outputs from Notebook 1A)
 
**2) Workshop 2**
 - Mutant vs Wild Type yeast cells image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks Notebook
 - Dataset (Training, Validation and Testing Folder of Images)
 - Support Files (Used to create Maxpool image example in tutorial)
 
## E. Coli Machine Learning (Using Moragadivand's paper Data)
Contains code to perform different Machine Learning Algorythms using E.Coli Data from Moragadivands Paper's Data and premise, 
each notebook was created as a series of steps designed to teach beginners the basics for data clean up, Machine Learning Algorythms using Sklearn, 
XGBoost and other python packages to predict Antibiotic Resistance in E. Coli using Population Structure, Gene Presence and Absence and Year of Isolation. The purpose of the notebooks is simply to help biology students familiarize themselves with machine learning algorythms so they can try using features they find more suitable in their own research projects.

Below is the list of Google Colab Notebook tutorials part of this project:

**1) Introduction to ML for Antibiotic Resistance Prediction for E.Coli**
   
**2) Logistic Regression**
   
**3) Random Forest**
   
**4) Extreme Gradient Boosted Trees**
   
**5) Deep Learning**
   
**6) Final Metrics graph**
