# Notebooks created under different SFSU Projects

## MARC Machine Learning

**Grant Recipient:** Raymond M Esquerra (Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San Francisco State University)

**Grant Name:** Demystifying Machine Learning and Best Data Practices Workshop Series for Underrepresented STEM Undergraduate and MS Researchers bound for PhD Training Programs

**Grant Number:** T34-GM008574

Contains 2 small projects geared towards teaching undergraduates a first quick glance at Machine Learning

**1) Workshop 1** (*Ported to Google Cloud Platform as part of the Grant*)
 - 1A) COVID data predictions using Decision Tree Notebook
 - 1B) Data Drifting and Model Performance Notebook
 - Dataset (Training (labels and features) and Testing (labels and features) CSV files)
 - Support Files (Unused for the Tutorial)
 - 2 CSV files (Outputs from Notebook 1A)
 
**2) Workshop 2**
 - Mutant vs Wild Type yeast cells image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks Notebook
 - Dataset (Training, Validation and Testing Folder of Images)
 - Support Files (Used to create Maxpool image example in tutorial)
 
## E. Coli Machine Learning (Using Moragadivand's paper Data)
Contains code to perform different Machine Learning Algorythms using E.Coli Data from Moragadivands Paper's Data and premise, 
each notebook was created as a series of steps designed to teach beginners the basics for data clean up, Machine Learning Algorythms using Sklearn, 
XGBoost and other python packages to predict Antibiotic Resistance in E. Coli using Population Structure, Gene Presence and Absence and Year of Isolation.
The first notebook contains basic explanations and background in genetics for the project. The subsequent ones contain basic explanations of all Machine Learning Models Used. 

1) Loading and Preparing Data for Machine Learning Models
2) Logistic Regression
3) Random Forest
4) Gradient Boosted Trees
5) Deep Learning
6) Final Metrics graph
