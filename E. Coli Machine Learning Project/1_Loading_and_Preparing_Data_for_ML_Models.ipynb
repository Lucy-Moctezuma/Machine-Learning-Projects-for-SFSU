        "\n",
        "Antibiotic resistance has become a global public health concern. Bacteria are evolving resistance to the current arsenal of prescribed antibiotics resulting in strains that are developing multi-drug resistance. Currently, doctors and clinics often perform traditional culture-based assays (i.e., testing whether a drug would kill the bacteria in a petri dish) to determine antibiotic resistance in bacterial strains. Alternatively, clinics can also choose to sequence these strains. These sequences can then be analyzed in order to predict if it will show resistance to a certain drug. There are different ways to perform the analysis and Machine Learning is one of them. This series of tutorials intends to help students understand how to do such analysis.\n",

        "We will process publically available whole genome sequences of *E. coli* strains to create Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Neural Network models to predict **Resistance (R)** and **Susceptibility (S)** for each strain. The strains have already been tested in the lab, so we will\n",
